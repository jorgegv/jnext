# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This repository contains the code for a ZX Spectrum Next emulator based on the official VHDL sources for the ZX Next FPGA core.

## Reference Files

- Emulator design plan: @EMULATOR-DESIGN-PLAN.md
- FPGA code analysis: @FPGA-REPO-ANALYSIS.md
- FPGA VHDL source (authoritative hardware spec): `/home/jorgegv/src/spectrum/ZX_Spectrum_Next_FPGA/cores/zxnext/src/`

## Constraints for development

- Do not include Co-Authored-by headers in commit messages
- Keep commit messages terse but insightful
- When reading daily prompt files (in directory `.prompts`, they contains tasks for the daily work), always keep a Task Completion Status section in each of them. Update this section whenever a task is finished.
- When launching Agent Teams, the Manager agent should NOT write or touch any code
- When launching Agent Teams, each independent function should be worked on in a different branch, to avoid code trashing between agents. When code is ready on each branch, they should be merged to main. If merge problems occur, the agent responsible for fixing them is the one that tried to merge last, and it should try to fix them on their own branch.
- Agents should NOT write to the main branch, ever. Only on their own branches and worktrees!
- Update task status on the main plan whenever a task is finished
