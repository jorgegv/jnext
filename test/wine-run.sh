# in: a private WINEPREFIX under the build tree, no wine debug noise, no Mono /
# Gecko prompt, and NO DISPLAY / WAYLAND_DISPLAY / XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, so nothing
# can ever open a window on the developer's desktop. The DLLs the executables
# link (SDL3, libpng, zlib, winpthreads, libstdc++ ...) are found through
# WINEPATH -- the MinGW sys-root and the build's own spdlog DLL -- rather than
# copied beside ninety executables.
#
# What wine cannot stand in for (accepted, owner 2026-10-10; documented in the
# developer guide): symlink creation, a real console attach for a GUI-subsystem
# exe, NTFS specifics (short names, streams).
